# GUI Scaling Factors
# Adjust these to scale the overall window size and font sizes
# Example: 1.0 = original size, 1.5 = 50% larger
size_scale = 1
font_scale = 1.1

# Base Window Dimensions (before scaling)
# These values will be multiplied by size_scale
# WIN_W = CANVAS_W + PAL_W
# WIN_H = CANVAS_H + INFO_H

[SIMULATION]
# Simulation Constants
# gmin_default: Minimum conductance added to diagonal (for stability)
# r_l_dc_short: Small resistance for 0H inductors or DC inductors (prevents infinite admittance)
